# Stanford RNA Challenge
- The aim of the challenge is to predict of the 3D sequence of RNA sequences.
- We need to make predictions for the x,y,z position of every nuclei.

# Plan
- We first will generate a simple baseline model.
- Then iterate on more advanced models.

# Code conventions
- Follow best practice according to google's coding conventions.
