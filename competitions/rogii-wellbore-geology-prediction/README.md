# Rogii — Wellbore Geology Prediction

**Task**: Predict TVT (True Vertical Thickness) in the post-PS zone of ~200 horizontal wells from GR logs and a typewell reference.
**Metric**: RMSE (ft) on post-PS rows. Lower is better.
**Deadline**: 30 July 2026

## Problem summary

Each horizontal well is drilled vertically then curves to horizontal. At the **Prediction Start (PS)** point, exact TVT measurements stop. The model must predict TVT for the remaining 4–6k ft of horizontal drilling using:

- `GR` — Gamma Ray log along the horizontal well (noisy, ~30% NaN after PS)
- `TVT_input` — exact TVT up to PS (anchor)
- Typewell `TVT, GR` — vertical reference well nearby (clean, 0.5 ft resolution)
- `X, Y, Z, MD` — borehole geometry

**TVT is a geological depth coordinate**, not physical depth. It measures "at this drill location, what depth in the typewell has the same rock?" After PS the well is nearly horizontal so TVT barely moves (±15 ft std), but predicting those small deviations precisely is the challenge.

## Baselines

| Method | Post-PS RMSE |
|---|---|
| Constant (predict TVT_at_PS) | 15.9 ft |
| Nearest-neighbour deviation (5-NN blend) | 13.8 ft |
| Current LightGBM (OOF all rows) | ~18 ft* |
| Public LB best (DWT-based) | 9.25 ft |

\* OOF measured across all rows including easy before-PS region. Post-PS only not yet measured.

**Key finding**: spatial proximity between wells does **not** help — TVT deviations are locally driven and don't correlate even between wells 400 ft apart. The GR signal is the only path to beating the constant baseline.

## Data

- **Train**: 773 horizontal wells + typewells, full TVT available for all rows
- **Test**: ~200 hidden wells (placeholder: 3 wells locally)
- **Coverage**: ~34 × 25 mile field
- **Submission**: `{well_id}_{row_idx}, tvt` for post-PS rows only

## Plan

### [x] Track 1 — Fix CV metric (immediate)
Evaluate OOF RMSE on **post-PS rows only**. Done — `post_ps_rmse` now logged as primary metric.

### [~] Track 2 — Feature improvements (fast)
Add to `train_rogii.py`:
- [x] `tvt_anchor` — TVT at PS (constant per well)
- [x] `delta_md_from_ps` — distance from PS anchor in MD
- [x] Predict deviation `TVT - tvt_anchor` instead of absolute TVT
- [x] GR pattern matching (4D KNN) against typewell + pre-PS self-reference

### [x] Track 3 — GR↔typewell sliding window correlation (main signal)
DEAD END: individual signals (GR, Z, dip) all fail. The post-PS TVT range (±20 ft) is too narrow for typewell GR matching. Pre-PS dip has zero correlation (r=-0.05) with post-PS dip.

### [~] Track 3b — Sequence model (dilated TCN, `train_seq.py`)
Causal 1D dilated TCN. Features: GR_norm, Z_delta, dX, dY, delta_MD, is_post_ps, tvt_dev_known.
Full sequences, dynamic padding per batch, loss only on post-PS rows.

**Diagnosis**: model barely beats constant. Root cause — model uses `tvt_dev_known` as passthrough
for pre-PS rows without learning from GR. To predict post-PS it just outputs ~0 (the PS anchor value).

**Next**: input masking — randomly zero `tvt_dev_known` for 50% of pre-PS rows during training,
forcing the model to learn GR→TVT from the pre-PS data. Also increase capacity (d_model 128, 8 layers).

### Track 4 — Sequence model improvements
- [~] Input masking: zero tvt_dev_known for random 50% of pre-PS rows (BERT-style)
- [ ] Auxiliary loss on pre-PS rows (train on pre-PS TVT deviations too)
- [ ] Larger model: d_model=128, n_layers=8 (wider receptive field ~1000 ft)

### Track 5 — Ensemble
Stack Tracks 2–4 with Ridge regression on OOF predictions.

## Dead ends

| Approach | Result | Why it failed |
|---|---|---|
| 5-NN spatial deviation | 13.8 ft (worse) | TVT deviations don't correlate spatially even at 400 ft |
| GR cross-correlation (full typewell) | 138 ft | Searches wrong TVT range without constraint |
| GR cross-correlation (constrained ±150 ft) | 71 ft | Horizontal GR and typewell GR waveforms don't match (corr=0.41, lateral heterogeneity) |
| GR calibrated typewell NN | 324 ft | Post-PS TVT range is ±20 ft — GR flat in typewell across that range, inversion impossible |
| EGFDU spatial interpolation from training wells | 30-65 ft | Different typewells have 644 ft std in egfdu_tw — values not comparable across wells |
| EGFDU XY-dip extrapolation from pre-PS | 27-45 ft | Pre-PS dip (curved section) doesn't match post-PS horizontal dip |
| Post-PS dip interpolation from training wells | 31 ft mean, catastrophic outliers | Dip varies ±0.18 ft/ft across field — interpolation fails for far wells |
| corr(pre-PS dip, post-PS dip) | r = -0.05 | Pre-PS dip has ZERO predictive power for post-PS dip |
| dTVT vs dGR correlation | r ≈ 0.0 | GR changes don't predict TVT changes at 1-ft scale |
| dTVT vs dZ correlation | r = -0.20 | Z only explains 4% of TVT variance (+0.4% improvement over constant) |
| Tabular GBM on GR matching features | ~15.96 ft | GBM can't exploit sequential GR structure — stuck at constant baseline |
| tvt_anchor + delta_md_from_ps features | 16.95 ft post-PS | Model predicting absolute TVT — drifts from anchor |
| Tabular GBM on GR matching features | ~15.96 ft | GBM can't exploit sequential GR structure — stuck at constant baseline |

## Results log

| Run | Model | Post-PS RMSE | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

| v1 | LightGBM 5-fold | TBD (all-rows only) | baseline, submission format fixed |
| v2 | + tvt_anchor + delta_md_from_ps | 16.95 ft | worse than constant — model predicting absolute TVT not anchored |
| v3 | + deviation target (TVT - tvt_anchor) | 15.99 ft | matches constant baseline — correct framing |
| v4 | + typewell pattern NN + prePS self-ref | 15.96 ft | marginal gain — tabular GBM can't exploit GR sequence structure |
| seq-v1 | TCN 5-fold truncated (500+2000) | 17.33 ft | truncation drops context; model uses tvt_dev_known passthrough |
| seq-v2 | TCN 5-fold full sequences | 15.86 ft | fold 1: 14.79 ft — below constant |
| seq-v3 | TCN 3-fold full sequences | **15.86 ft** | fold 1: 14.79 ft — same; model still near constant baseline |
